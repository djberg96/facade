== Synopsis
   An easy way to implement the facade pattern in your classes. In short,
   this library wraps singleton methods from another class as instance
   methods of the current class.

== Prerequisites
   Ruby 1.8.2 or later

== Installation
   rake test
   rake install (non-gem) or rake install_gem (gem)
   
== Usage
   require 'facade'
   class MyString < String
      extend Facade
      facade File, :dirname, :basename
   end

   f = MyString.new('/home/djberge')
   puts f.basename # 'djberge'
   puts f.dirname  # '/home'
